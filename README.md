## Product Vision Statement


## User Requirements
Tuo:
    1. As an NYU student, I want to verify my account with my school email so that I can trust that users are part of the NYU community. 
    2. As a buyer, I want to see the verification badge and reputation score so that I can avoid any unsafe or risky transaction. 
    3. As a seller, I want to rate buyers’ reliability so that I can avoid no-shows. 
    4. As a seller, I want to see the suggested prices based on similar items so that I can price my items/lists fairly.
